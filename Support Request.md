GitHub Support Request Process

If you need to make a request for support we would like you to use the issues features to make your request
This link (https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) will provide you with helpful information on using the issues feature.

When creating an issue go into the support repository and select the issues icon on the right side of the page. After you have selected the issues tab within the Support repository write up your support request.  Within your write up us an “@mention” to either your technical POC or any of the organization’s technical support users. After you have written your request and used the “@mention” to tag the appropriate user use the Support request label.
